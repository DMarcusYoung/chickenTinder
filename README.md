You know when you and your significant other are hungry, but can't decide on a place to eat? Well, say goodbye to those days, welcome to Chicken Tinder!
An application that works much like the popular dating app Tinder, but instead of swiping on human beings, you swipe on restaurants.
When you and your partner swipe right on the same restaurant, you'll be matched, thus taking away all the wasted time of debating where to eat.
Simply create a personal room with the city you're in, share that room code with whoever you'd like to eat with, and you're off!
